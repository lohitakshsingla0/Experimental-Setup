# Experimental Research Environment for Chatbot Interactions

This repository contains the implementation of an experimental setup designed to study chatbot interactions. It focuses on comparing small-screen and full-screen chatbot interfaces and analyzing dark patterns embedded in chatbot conversations.

---

## 📚 **Overview**

This project supports research on two primary objectives:
1. **Chatbot Interface Comparison**: Evaluate usability, engagement, and user satisfaction across small-screen and full-screen chatbot designs.
2. **Dark Pattern Analysis**: Study the impact of manipulative design patterns in chatbot interactions on user trust, decision-making, and satisfaction.

The experimental setup provides a controlled, adaptable environment for testing, analyzing, and generating data for these objectives.

## 🚀 **Features**

### 1. **Chatbot Interface Comparison**
- Analyze usability, engagement, and user satisfaction metrics.
- Compare small-screen (pop-up) and full-screen chatbot interfaces.

### 2. **Dark Pattern Analysis**
- Embed predefined dark patterns in chatbot interactions.
- Evaluate user behavior, trust, and satisfaction through survey responses and interaction logs.

### 3. **Modular and Configurable Environment**
- Flexible configuration for new use cases and experimental scenarios.
- Modular design to extend chatbot functionalities.

### 4. **Automated Data Logging**
- Real-time logging of user interactions and chatbot responses.
- Automated survey collection and feedback aggregation.

### 5. **Admin Dashboard**
- Manage experiment scenarios and monitor ongoing sessions.
- View and export interaction logs and user feedback.

## 📊 **Experimental Setup Details**

This project serves two key research objectives:

### **1. Interface Comparison**
- **Focus:** Evaluate differences between small-screen and full-screen chatbot interfaces.
- **Metrics:** User engagement, task completion time, user satisfaction, and trust.

### **2. Dark Pattern Analysis**
- **Focus:** Investigate the impact of deceptive patterns in chatbot interactions.
- **Metrics:** User frustration levels, trust impact, task completion rates, and behavioral patterns.

Both setups include survey forms and automated interaction logs for quantitative and qualitative analysis.
