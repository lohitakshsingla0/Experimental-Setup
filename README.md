## Features

1. **Chatbot Interface Comparison**:
   - Evaluate user engagement, usability, and satisfaction in small-screen vs. full-screen chatbot designs.

2. **Dark Pattern Analysis**:
   - Embed dark patterns in chatbot interactions using predefined use cases.
   - Conduct experiments to collect user responses and collect feedback through surveys on user engagement, trust, and satisfaction.

3. **Modular and Configurable**:
   - Easily adapt to new use cases and scenarios for experimentation.

4. **Automated Data Logging**:
   - Record interaction logs and feedback for in-depth analysis.
